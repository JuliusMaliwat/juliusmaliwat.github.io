draft: false
summary: "A Chrome extension that interrupts impulsive browsing and turns every session into an intentional, time-boxed action."
problem: "Social feeds and content rabbit holes steal attention because there is no friction before opening a distracting tab."
solution: "The extension pauses selected domains, asks for your intention, starts a timer, and keeps your goal visible while you browse."
highlights:
  - "Intent prompt appears before interaction on guarded domains."
  - "Built-in timer and fallback math gate reduce autopilot scrolling."
  - "Insights dashboard shows intention quality and browsing patterns over time."

## What changes for users

Instead of opening a distracting site and deciding too late, users pause first and choose why they are there. This small interruption creates deliberate browsing sessions and clearer outcomes.

## Privacy model

All data stays local in the browser. No external tracking, no account requirement, and no cloud sync.

## Roadmap

- Publish stable Chrome Web Store release.
- Add richer weekly trend reports in Insights.
- Add quick templates for recurring intentions.
